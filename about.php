		<p>Lend It is a website made for students in Odense, in need of different things.</p>
		<p><strong>You need it? Why not lend it!</strong><br>
Have you lost your bicycle, and therefore your only transport to school and work? Look for a bike here, and lend it while you get yourself a new one.
Do you have things you do not use â€“ but others might have use for? Make a post and tell everyone that you will lend it out!</p>
